# ft_print 

The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf().
You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments.
## Chalenges 

- [ ] variadic functions
- [ ] Create Makefile file
- [ ] Create mandatory files
- [ ] Create a prototype function on ft_printf.h "int ft_printf(const char *, ...);"
Yu have to implement the following conversions:
- [ ]  %c Prints a single character.
• %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
• %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
• %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
• %i Prints an integer in base 10.
• %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
• %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
• %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
• %% Prints a percent sign




 ## Requiriments 

- [ ] Don’t implement the buffer management of the original printf().
- [ ] Your function has to handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
- [ ] Your function will be compared against the original printf().
- [ ] You must use the command ar to create your library.
Using the libtool command is forbidden.
- [ ] Your libftprintf.a has to be created at the root of your repository.
