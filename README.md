### ðŸŒ  The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf().

### You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments.

## Chalenges

- [x] variadic functions
- [x] Create Makefile file
- [ ] Create mandatory files
- [x] Create a prototype function on ft_printf.h "int ft_printf(const char *, ...);"
 ## RequirimentsËœ`

- [ ] Donâ€™t implement the buffer management of the original printf().
- [ ] Your function has to handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
- [ ] Your function will be compared against the original printf().
- [ ] You must use the command ar to create your library.
*Using the libtool command is forbidden.*
- [ ] Your libftprintf.a has to be created at the root of your repository.
### You have to implement the following conversions:
- [ ] %c Prints a single character.
- [ ] %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
- [ ] %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
- [ ] %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
- [ ] %i Prints an integer in base 10.
- [ ] %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
- [ ] %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
- [ ] %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
- [ ] %% Prints a percent sign

#### Bonus Part

*You donâ€™t have to do all the bonuses.*


Bonus list:
- [ ] Manage any combination of the following flags: â€™-0.â€™ and the field minimum width
under all conversions.
- [ ] Manage all the following flags: â€™# +â€™ (Yes, one of them is a space)
